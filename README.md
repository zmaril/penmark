all those numbers need a new place to live

* /notes - notes about sudoku and it's variants 
* /webapp - a web application written in elixir that one day will make it easy to create and solve sudokus. 
* /rust_library - a rust library for messing with puzzles. 

# Roadmap 

* Create a library in rust that embodies the ideas in [`Penmark Puzzling Language`](https://github.com/zmaril/penmark/blob/7469b7e4b46279a816c9c8f48b23de039ba6bc3b/notes/PenmarkPuzzlingLanguage.md) while still just being a rust library. 
* Create a library in elixir with rustler that wraps the penmark rust library in genservers. 
* Create a liveview application that uses the above library to make creating and solving puzzles easier. 
* Make a bunch of cool puzzles.
